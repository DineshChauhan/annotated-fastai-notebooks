A repository of official *Fast.ai v3 part 2* course notebooks with added hyperlinks to video lectures of the course.

By following a *"Jump to..."* link you would land on a time point of a video lecture where Jeremy Howard explains the code next to the notebook cell with the link. 

These notebooks are being created for my own learning. I hope someone else would find them useful as well.

I am planing to go through all videos as the course progresses and gradually hyperlink all notebooks in this course.

My handle on the fast.ai forum is @sergeman. If you have questions or suggestions, send me a message  on the form.
