Fast.ai v3 part 2 course Jupyter notebooks with hyperlinks to certain timepoints in the lecture video of the course.

These notebooks are for my own learning. I hope someone else would find this useful as well.

I am planing to go through all videos as the course progresses and gradually hyperlink all notebooks in this course.

My handle on the fast.ai forum is @sergeman. Send me a message on the forum.
